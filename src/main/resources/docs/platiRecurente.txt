## Recurring Payments
Automate your regular bills or transfers so you never miss a payment.

### Where to find it
1. From your **Dashboard**, tap the **Recurring payments** button (calendar icon).
2. You’ll land on the **Recurring Payments** screen.

### Viewing your scheduled payments
- If you haven’t set up any, you’ll see a message:
  > You have no recurring payments.
  and a **+** button in the bottom right to add one.
- Otherwise, each payment appears as a card showing:
  - **Service name** (what you’re paying)
  - **Short description** (your note)
  - **Next payment date**
  - **Amount & currency** (e.g. “100USD”)
  - **Frequency** (Daily/ Weekly/ Monthly/ Annually)
  - **Card** (which of your cards will pay, with last 4 digits)
  - **Status** (ACTIVE or PAUSED)

1. Tap the **+** button in the bottom right.
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **User/Service name\*** – at least 3 characters

   - **Payment amount\*** – a number greater than 0
   - **Frequency\*** – pick Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Annually
