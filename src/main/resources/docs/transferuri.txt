## Transfers
Move money quickly between your own cards or send to someone else—right from your Dashboard.

### 1. Open the transfer form
- On your **Dashboard**, look for the row of three large white buttons just below your balance card.
- Tap the **middle** button labeled **Money transfer**

### 2. Pick “To my own card” or “To someone else”
- **To my own card**: send between your linked cards.
- **To someone else**: send to any valid IBAN.

### 3. Complete the form
- **Source Card***: tap and choose which of your cards will pay.
- **Transfer Type***: pick “To my own card” or “To someone else.”
- **Destination Card (own)** (internal only): pick your target card (all except the one you just chose).
- **Beneficiary Name*** (external only): type the recipient’s name or service.
- **Beneficiary IBAN*** (external only): enter the destination IBAN.
- **Amount***: type how much you want to send (must be more than 0 and no more than your source card’s balance).

### 4. Instant checks on your device
- We flag any empty or incorrectly formatted fields (e.g. too‑short IBAN, non‑numeric amount).
- For “To someone else,” we auto‑verify the IBAN via our `/api/card/verify-beneficiary` endpoint.
- We ensure you don’t send more than you have.

### 5. Review and confirm
- Once everything looks good, you’ll see a **Transfer Summary** screen showing:
  - Your **Source Card**
  - Your **Destination Card** (or the **Beneficiary Name + IBAN**)
  - The **Amount**
- Enter your app **password** to finalize.

### 6. Behind the scenes
1. We verify your password (`POST /api/users/verify-password`).
2. We fetch your blockchain key (`GET /api/users/get-blockchain-key`).
3. We submit the transfer (`POST /api/card/transfer`) with:
   - `fromCardId`, `destId` (card ID or resolved IBAN card ID),
   - `amount`, `transactionType`, `beneficiaryName`/`beneficiaryIban`.
4. We log it in your history (`POST /api/transactions/save`).

### 7. If something goes wrong
- Any network or server errors pop up as alerts.
- Fields with problems show an error message underneath.
- When it succeeds, you’ll see a “Transfer successful” alert and the form will clear.
