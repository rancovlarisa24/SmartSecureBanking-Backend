## Account Management
Quickly view your profile info, update your avatar, or sign out—right from your Dashboard.

### 1. Open the Manage Account screen
- On your **Dashboard**, locate the card showing your name and funds.
- Tap the **Manage your account** button (the one with the user‑icon).
- You’ll be taken to the **Manage Account** screen.

### 2. View your username
- At the top of **Manage Account**, your username is displayed.
- It’s fetched automatically from the server each time you open the screen.

### 3. Add or change your profile picture
- Tap your current avatar (or the default icon if none is set).
- Select a photo from your device’s gallery.
- The new image uploads immediately and replaces your old one.
- **Tip:** If you see a network error, verify your internet connection and that the app has gallery permissions.

### 4. Log out
- Tap the **Log out** button at the bottom of the screen.
- You’ll be signed out and taken back to the login screen.
- Your session token is removed from local storage for security—ideal on shared devices.
