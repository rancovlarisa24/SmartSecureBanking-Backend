### Create Virtual Card
A three‑step form that guides you through card generation.

#### Step 1 – Pick a funding card
- A horizontal list shows all your active physical cards.
- Tap a card to select it (gold border = selected).
- If no active cards exist → message “No active cards available.”

#### Step 2 – Set transaction limit (USD)
- Enter the maximum amount that any single transaction on the virtual card can reach (e.g., **100.00**).
- The field validates for numeric value > 0 and shows inline errors if something is wrong.

#### Step 3 – Choose a personalized name
- Give the card a friendly label (e.g., “Netflix 2025” or “Holiday Shopping”).
- Helps you recognize the card later in statements.

#### Confirm
- Tap **Generate Virtual Card** to send `POST /api/virtual-cards/create` with:
  - userId,
  - selectedCardId,
  - transactionLimit,
  - personalizedName.
- On success → “Success” alert and automatic navigation back to the Dashboard.

### What happens next
- A brand‑new card number, CVV, and expiry date are created server‑side.
- The virtual card draws funds from the physical card you selected.
- You can pause or delete the virtual card from the **Cards** section.
