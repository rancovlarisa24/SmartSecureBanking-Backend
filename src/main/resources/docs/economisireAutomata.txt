## Automatic Savings
A round‑up feature that tucks away spare change every time you spend.

### How to open
1. Open the **Side Menu**.
2. Tap **Automatic Savings**.

Introduces the concept and lets you enable it.

#### Screen layout
- **Hero image** – animated savings‑jar.
- **Title** – “Automatic Savings”.
- **Explanation** – short paragraph explaining round‑ups in plain language.
- **“How it works” mini‑guide** (three icons in a row):
  1. *Pay* with your card.
  2. We *round up* to the nearest dollar (or chosen multiple).
  3. The *difference* moves instantly into your savings pocket.
- **Activate Now** – big gradient button at the bottom.

#### What happens when you press **Activate Now**
