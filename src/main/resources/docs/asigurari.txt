## Insurance
Everything you need to compare, purchase, and manage your insurance policies.

### How to open
1. Open the **Side Menu**.
2. Tap **Insurance policy**.

The app shows the **Insurance Hub** screen (see below).

### Insurance Hub
An introductory screen that explains your options and starts the purchase flow.

#### Screen layout
- **Hero image** – shield/umbrella icon.
- **Title** – “Insurance”.
- **Explanation** – short paragraph about the policy types you can buy (Auto, Health, Home).
- **“How it works” mini‑guide** – three steps:
  1. *Compare offers*
  2. *Complete the form*
  3. *Confirm and pay*
- **Purchase policy** – large gradient button that opens *Available insurances*.

### Available insurances
Where you actually choose a policy.

#### Screen layout
- **Category sections** – policies are grouped automatically into **Auto**, **Health**, and **Home**.
- Each policy card shows:
  - ▼ Title
  - ▼ Price, Coverage, Benefits
  - ▼ Provider
  - **Choose** – gradient button that starts the purchase flow for that policy.
- **My Insurances** – simple button below the list; opens *Purchased insurances*.

### Purchase flow
A dynamic three‑step form: enter asset/person details, pick a payment card, and confirm.

#### Step 1 – Enter asset details
The form adapts to the category:

- **Auto** – Brand, Model, Manufacturing Year, VIN/Registration, Damage history (optional).
- **Health** – First name, Last name, Birthdate, Pre‑existing conditions (optional).
- **Home** – Property address, Area, Construction year, Construction details (optional).

> **Tip:** Fields marked with “*” are required; errors appear under the form if something is missing.

#### Step 2 – Select payment card
- A horizontal list shows all your active cards.
- Tap a card to select it (gold border = selected).
- If no active cards exist → message “No active cards available.”

#### Step 3 – Confirm & pay
- The **Purchase** button sends `POST /api/user-insurances`.
- On success → “Success” alert and redirect to *Purchased insurances*.

### Purchased insurances
A carousel containing every policy you’ve bought, displayed one at a time.

#### Screen layout
- **Infinite carousel** – swipe horizontally; pagination dots under the card.
- Each card shows:
  - Header with the policy title.
  - Two‑column pairs: Category / Price, Coverage / Provider.
  - Benefits as a text block.
  - **Insured asset** – section that displays the extra fields entered at purchase (e.g., VIN, address, birthdate).

> **Navigation tip:** If you have only one policy, the carousel behaves like a static card with no pagination dots.

Add or activate a card in **Virtual card** or **Cards**, then return to the payment step.
