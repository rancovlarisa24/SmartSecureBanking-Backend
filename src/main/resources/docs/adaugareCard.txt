## Add Card
Register a new physical debit or credit card so you can fund transfers, virtual cards, automatic savings, and more.

### How to open
1. Go to **Dashboard** (Home).
2. On the **Account summary card** tap **Manage your debit cards**.
3. Inside the **Cards** manager tap the floating action button ** Add new card**.
   → The **Add new Card** form opens.

### Add Card screen
A guided form that validates every detail before saving the card to your profile.

#### Screen layout
- **Card preview** – stylised mock‑up at the top (chip, masked number, holder, expiry).
- **Input form** – seven stacked fields:
  1. **Cardholder name**
  2. **Card number** – auto‑formats as you type
  3. **IBAN** – supports RO, DE, FR, IT, GB, NL, ES, PT; checks format & checksum.
  4. **Expiry (MM/YYYY)** – auto‑inserts “/”, rejects past dates.
  5. **CVV** – 3 digits, eye icon toggles visibility.
  6. **Available balance** – digits with optional decimals (.xx).
  7. **Personalised card name** – friendly label shown in app lists.
- **Save Card** button – stays disabled until every field is valid.

#### Real‑time validations
| Field | Validation rules |
| --- | --- |
| Card number | 16 digits, Luhn algorithm. |
| IBAN | Country‑specific length, structure, modulo‑97 checksum. |
| Expiry | Exact `MM/YYYY` format, must be a future date. |
| CVV | Exactly 3 digits. |
| Balance | Numeric, up to two decimals, > 0. |

Inline error messages appear in red beneath any field that fails validation.

#### Behind‑the‑scenes steps on **Save Card**
1. **BIN lookup** – first 6 digits sent to `https://lookup.binlist.net/{BIN}`; auto‑fills *Bank issuer* and *Currency*.
2. **PayPal check** – `POST /api/card/validate` confirms the card can authorise online payments.
3. **Secure save** – `POST /api/card/add` (with auth token) stores the encrypted card data.
4. **Success alert** – “Card successfully validated!” and automatic return to the **Cards** manager.

### After saving
- The new card appears in **Cards** with your personalised name.
- It becomes selectable in: Money transfer, Virtual Card funding, Automatic Savings, etc.

### FAQ
**Why is the IBAN required?**
It lets you receive incoming transfers and FX top‑ups directly to the card account.

**Is my CVV stored?**
No. Only a tokenised hash is kept; the raw CVV never touches our servers.

**My card was rejected – what next?**
Ensure number, expiry, and CVV are correct. Pre‑paid or region‑restricted cards can fail the PayPal check.

**Can I edit a saved card?**
You can rename or deactivate it in **Cards**. To change the number, expiry or CVV, delete the card and add it again.

**Which currencies are supported?**
Any currency issued by your bank. The BIN lookup fills in the primary currency, and the app converts automatically when you spend.
